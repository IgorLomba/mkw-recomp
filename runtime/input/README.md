# runtime/input

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `input.c`, `input.h`, `input_map.*` | Controller state and remapping; one gamepad per player for local multiplayer (`MKW_VIRTUAL_PADS=N` adds N virtual SDL gamepads to try it without controllers); the last device used (keyboard or controller, for the button icons) |
| `input_script.*` | Button script (`MKW_INPUT_SCRIPT`; a `p<N> ` prefix presses for player N, also through `ctl press`; paused while an `MKW_SEQ_HOLD` phase lasts; a `<phase>+<ticks> BUTTON` line counts from the start of that phase, with `MKW_SEQ_WATCH=1`); the A button of `MKW_SKIP_MOVIES` (`core/hacks/skip.c`) and `MKW_CTL` presses |
| `input_sdl.*`, `input_wsys.h` | SDL3 back end |
| `motion_fusion.c` | Gyro and accelerometer |
| `switch2_proto.h` | The Switch 2 controllers' Bluetooth LE protocol (Pro Controller 2, Joy-Con 2: GATT ids, handshake, reports, stick calibration, rumble, pairing), from seedds/mkw-neo (MIT) with our button bits; checked by `tests/test_switch2.py` |
| `switch2.h`, `switch2.c` | Switch 2 controllers over Bluetooth LE (`MKW_SWITCH2`, off by default; SDL has them over USB only): the session on top of a transport (identity, pairing, calibration, features, player lights, rumble), each pad a virtual SDL gamepad with its gyro, so players, layout and rumble work as for any gamepad |
| `linux_switch2.c` | Its Linux transport: BlueZ over the system D-Bus, libdbus-1 loaded at run time; `MKW_SWITCH2=2` logs each advertising device once |
| `switch2_win.c` | Its Windows transport: not written yet (says so in the log) |

Default keyboard (`input_map.c`, changeable in the `.ini`):
