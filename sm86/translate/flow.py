"""Structured control flow for a program's GLSL: if / else and do / while from its BRA instructions, in place of the
switch on the pc that glsl.translate falls back to.

Why: drivers compile the structured form much faster than a state machine. SavageWindRecomp measured it on Maxwell
shaders on the same Radeon 660M (runtime/nvn/maxwell/translate.c structure_flow @ 663cff16, MIT: RADV compile time of
a sample 42.9 -> 14.6 s of CPU), and glslc gains the same way. The idea and the cases are theirs; SM86 needs less of
it: BSSY/BSYNC are scheduling hints the translator drops, and EXIT is a GLSL return, valid anywhere in main.

A forward conditional BRA over [n, t) becomes `if (!cond) { [n, t) }`, or if / else when the code before t ends with
an unconditional jump further on; a backward BRA at `back` to `i` becomes `do { [i, back) } while (cond);`; an
unconditional forward jump skips dead code. Anything else (a jump into or out of a range other than its own end,
CALL, RET, BRX) raises Fail and the caller keeps the switch.
