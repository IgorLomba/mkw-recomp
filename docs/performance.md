# Performance

Frame times measured on real machines, each with its date: the code changes every week, so an old row says what that
build did, not what today's does. MKW asks for 60 fps in races (16.7 ms per frame); on the console, when a frame takes
longer, the game itself drops to 30 fps (33.3 ms), and Settings > Screen > Frame rate on Automatic does the same here
since 0.1.5 (12/11/2026: no switch between 60 and 30 in nine races). A frame time over 33.3 ms means slow motion even
at 30: the game counts each frame as 1/30 s. The log's `game: speed` lines give the game speed of a run.

To add your machine, open a [performance report](https://github.com/adriadam10/mkw-recomp/issues/new?template=performance.yml);
it is added here with the issue's date and a link to it.

Players' rows come from the log attached to each report, not from the times written in it (they were often better
than the log): the median of its 60-second frame-time windows, or of its race windows where the run had
`MKW_TRACE=perf`. Left out: reports without a log, runs with frame generation on, and crash reports (those through
RecompLauncher carry only the end of the log).
