"""Hash the GLSL and reflection that sm86/translate gives for every extracted program, one line per program.

Why: a refactor of the translator must not change its output; two hash files compared with `cmp` say it in ~1 min,
without glslc (the census recompiles every program whose GLSL changed and does not show where).

Usage: uv run tools/shaders/glsl_hash.py OUT.tsv   (before and after the change, then `cmp before.tsv after.tsv`)
